I ran into my first issue working in IntelliJ that involved using JSTL. I learned that I need to always use <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %> instead of an include directive when working with JSTL in IntelliJ.

I also started looking at a few different services that could be used for OCR:
