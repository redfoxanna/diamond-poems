# Weekly Reflection

Documenting how my week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 1

1/19/2024- 7.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Thought of a project idea

I have a solid idea for the individual project and am anxious to get started. One area I struggled with a little bit was getting specific on the project plan with regard to what exactly I'll be doing in the later weeks. I think once I have the screen layout complete this coming week, it will make it much easier to add more detail to the plan.

I also started looking at a few different services that could be used:

* Here's the home page for the google maps web services: https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview?hl=en This can be used to display a map of the trail location.
* A service to identify the current snow depth, most recent snowfal, etc.  Looks like this data is available: http://www.weather.gov/nerfc/snow, but I did not quickly find a service that returns the data. Will keep searching. Scraping the details from something like this, may work as well: http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa/reports.html?region=National&var=snowdepth&dy=2016&dm=1&dd=24&units=e&sort=value&filter=0
* A service for current weather conditions migth be helpful as well. http://openweathermap.org looks promising and they have a free tier. There's also some integration with google maps, so I think I may be able to project weather data over the google map?
