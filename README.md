# Diamond Poem Archives

This repository will serve as an example for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

### Problem Statement

At the beginning of our game nights, we often kick things off with a warm-up we've coined "Diamond Poems." It's a collaborative poem writing exercise where each person contributes one line at a time on scraps of paper, with only the previous line visible. This unique format leads to the creation of hilarious, creative, and sometimes thought-provoking poems.
But, as the night winds down, these poetic masterpieces face an uncertain fate â€“ they're scattered, misplaced, and often lost to the night. Well, almost all of them, because there's this one friend (*ahem* Brooke!) who manages to collect and safeguard them all.
Enter my indie project idea: envision a Java application that would interface with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API. This would transform the images of our handwritten Diamond Poems into searchable text. Now, no longer will these poetic gems be lost to the passage of time. They're immortalized, ready to be easily retrieved whenever the waves of nostalgia hit.
